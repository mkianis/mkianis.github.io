Hello and welcome to my website! I am Mostafa, a geoscientist passionate about Earth dynamics. I develop and implements mathematical tools to investigate the Earth system. My current main focus is on machine learning for weather and climate dynamics. [I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in climate dynamics group, Department of Meteorology and Geophysics, University of Vienna](https://klimadynamik.univie.ac.at/?page_id=251), funded by a Swiss National Science Foundation mobility fellowship. Before that, I did a short postdoctral stint at ETH Zürich, where previously I obtained my PhD as well. 

You can look at the full list of my publications on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qCI0O08AAAAJ&hl=en), [Researchgate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mostafa-Kiani-Shahvandi), and [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5705-7014) profiles.
